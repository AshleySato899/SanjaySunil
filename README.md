**Hey!** I'm a 14y/o student developer studying Computer Science and specializing in full-stack development. Some technologies I enjoy working with include React, Node and Firebase. I love creating software, exploring new technologies and spending my free time contributing to the open-source community.

- **Founder of [BetterDiscordPanel](https://github.com/D3VSJ/BetterDiscordPanel)** - a new messaging panel designed to allow users to message inside of a discord bot and view bot information. I started this project back in June 2020, and have used it to advance my knowledge in languages.
